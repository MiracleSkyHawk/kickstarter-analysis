# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise tried to use fundraising campaigns to raise money for her play Fever. She was able to raise a considerable amount of fund for her play quite quickly. In order to understand how to increase the possibility of success, an analysis has been performed on the Kickstarter dataset which contains information of a large number of different campaigns. 

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to analyze the Kickstarter Excel sheet that contains the information about different fundraising campaigns in order to find out how their launch dates and their funding goals are correlated to the campaign outcomes. Visualizations are used to represent the results and provide insights.

## Analysis and Challenges

This analysis emphasized on the following factors that have impact on the success rate of a campaign.
- Launch Date
- Goals
